All tests can assume that they are running as root in a Debian Linux Docker
container.

The yaesm test suite is assumed to be ran in a Docker container. For this reason
tests don't have to worry about cleaning up state, which allows for easier
debugging. It is very unwise to run the test suite outside of a Docker container
as your system may get mangled. Always use docker-pytest.sh to run the test
suite.

See docker-pytest.sh and Dockerfile_pytest for more information.
